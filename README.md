# Packer Scripts for Prowl

The first thing is you can pick what script you need, as soon as you start the Vagrant box, via 

<pre>vagrant up</pre> 

Once you've done that make sure you have all of the dependecies you need, run 

<pre>brew install qt</pre> 

Once you've done that, install VMWare Fusion, these scripts are made for and optimzed for VMWare Fusion rather than VirtualBox, in the Prowl private repo, there are some keys left to get the $80 version of VMWare Fusion, so please look in there if you need VMWare Fusion.
